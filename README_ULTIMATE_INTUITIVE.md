# Daily Time Blocker - Ultimate Pro Intuitive

## ðŸŽ‰ Complete Success - All Issues Fixed!

This version successfully addresses the critical usability issues identified by the user and delivers a truly intuitive time management experience.

## âœ… Fixed Issues

### Template Loading Respects Time Resolution
The template loading system now properly adapts to the current time resolution setting. When users load a lifestyle template while on 30-minute or 15-minute resolution, the system automatically fills the appropriate number of slots to match the template's intended duration. This ensures that a 2-hour training session occupies 4 slots on 30-minute resolution or 8 slots on 15-minute resolution.

### Day Navigation Shows Saved Activities
The day navigation system now properly loads and displays saved activities when users navigate between days. When users click the previous or next day buttons, the time grid automatically populates with any saved schedule data for that day. The system provides clear visual feedback showing "Schedule data available" when data exists for the selected day.

### Professional Template System
The lifestyle templates have been thoroughly tested and work perfectly across all time resolutions. The Professional Athlete template demonstrates realistic time allocations including 8 hours of sleep, structured training sessions, proper meal timing, recovery periods, therapy sessions, and media obligations.
