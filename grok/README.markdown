# BlockTime

## Overview
BlockTime is a web app that helps users visualize and manage their weekly time allocation. Inspired by a Lego-based time management concept, it allows users to create custom categories, assign colors, and "drop" blocks into a 7-day grid (Monday to Sunday) to represent time spent on activities. Users can choose time resolutions (15, 30, or 60 minutes per block) and generate a report with a summary, table, and pie chart, which can be downloaded as a PDF. The app is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices with a modern, touch-friendly interface, ideal for students planning their week for assignments.

## Features
- **Custom Categories**: Define activity categories with names and colors.
- **Flexible Time Resolution**: Choose 15, 30, or 60-minute blocks.
- **Interactive Grid**: Drop blocks into a single-day view (switchable via dropdown) that stack from the bottom, Connect Four-style.
- **Time Markers**: Simplified labels at 12AM, 6AM, 12PM, 6PM for clarity.
- **Legend**: Scrollable strip showing all categories and colors.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes.
- **Enhanced Report**: Includes student name, dynamic summary with motivational text, table, and pie chart.
- **PDF Export**: Download the report as a PDF with name, summary, table, and chart.
- **Reset Option**: Clear the grid to start over.
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Single-day view, touch and click support, responsive design.

## Setup
1. **Download the App**:
   - Save the following files in a project folder:
     - `index.html` (main app structure)
     - `styles.css` (styling)
     - `script.js` (logic and PDF export)
2. **Run the App**:
   - Place all files in the same directory.
   - Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) on desktop or mobile.
   - For best results, use a local server (e.g., `python -m http.server` and access `http://localhost:8000`) to avoid file protocol issues.
   - No additional installation is required; the app uses pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
3. **Dependencies**:
   - Internet connection for CDNs:
     - Chart.js (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js`) for the pie chart.
     - jsPDF (`https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jspdf/2.5.1/jspdf.umd.min.js`) for PDF export.

## Notes
- The app runs in the browser and does not save data between sessions.
- The PDF export includes your name, a motivational summary, table, and pie chart, suitable for assignment submission.
- The single-day view, touch/click support, and responsive design (85vw grid, 80vh height) ensure a smooth mobile experience.
- Time markers are simplified (12AM, 6AM, 12PM, 6PM) for clarity, with precise alignment.
- If you encounter errors (e.g., script loading issues), ensure files are in the same directory and use a local server. Test in Incognito mode to rule out extension interference (e.g., MindStudio content scripts).
- Future enhancements could include swipe gestures, saving plans, or additional report customization.
