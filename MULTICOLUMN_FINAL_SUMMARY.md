## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### CSS Changes
```css
/* Multi-column time grid wrapper */
.time-grid-wrapper {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    gap: 20px;
}

/* Responsive breakpoints */
@media (max-width: 1400px) {
    .time-grid-wrapper {
        grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
    }
}

@media (max-width: 900px) {
    .time-grid-wrapper {
        grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    }
}
```

### JavaScript Modifications
Modified `generateTimeGrid()` function to:
1. Create wrapper div for multi-column layout
2. Define three time periods with start/end hours
3. Loop through each period to create columns
4. Generate time slots within each column
5. Maintain all existing event handlers
