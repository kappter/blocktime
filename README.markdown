# BlockTime

## Overview
BlockTime is a simple web app that helps users visualize and manage their weekly time allocation. Inspired by a Lego-based time management concept, it allows users to create custom categories, assign colors, and "drop" blocks into a 7-day grid (Monday to Sunday) to represent time spent on activities. Each block shows its category and time range (e.g., "Sleep: 8:00-8:30 PM"), with running totals for categories and the overall week displayed below the grid. Users can copy a day's schedule, save it as a reusable "day type" (e.g., Work, Weekend), save/load the schedule as a JSON file, and undo mistaken block placements. The app supports time resolutions (15, 30, or 60 minutes per block) and generates a report with a summary, table, color-coded week view, and pie chart, downloadable as a PDF. Itâ€™s optimized for desktop and mobile with a touch-friendly interface, ideal for students planning their week for assignments.
