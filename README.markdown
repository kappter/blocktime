# BlockTime

## Overview
BlockTime is a web app that helps users visualize and manage their weekly time allocation. Inspired by a Lego-based time management concept, it allows users to create custom categories, assign colors, and "drop" blocks into a 7-day grid (Monday to Sunday) to represent time spent on activities. Each block shows its category and time range (e.g., "Sleep: 8:00-8:30 PM"), with running totals for categories and the overall week displayed below the grid. Users can copy a day's schedule, save it as a reusable "day type" (e.g., Work, Weekend, Holiday, Travel), save/load the schedule as a JSON file, and undo mistaken block placements. The app supports time resolutions (15, 30, or 60 minutes per block) and generates a report with a summary, table, and pie chart, downloadable as a PDF. Itâ€™s optimized for desktop and mobile with a touch-friendly interface, ideal for students planning their week for assignments.

## Features

## Setup
1. **Download the App**:
   - Save the following files in a project folder:
     - `index.html` (main app structure)
     - `styles.css` (styling)

2. **Run the App**:
   - Place all files in the same directory.
   - Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) on desktop or mobile.
   - For best results, use a local server (e.g., `python -m http.server` and access `http://localhost:8000`) to avoid file protocol issues.
   - No additional installation is required; the app uses pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
3. **Dependencies**:
   - Internet connection for CDNs:
     - Chart.js (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js`) for the pie chart.
     - jsPDF (`https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jspdf/2.5.1/jspdf.umd.min.js`) for PDF export.

## Notes
- The app runs in the browser and does not save data between sessions (day types, schedules, and undo stack reset on reload unless saved/loaded).
- Block labels show the category and time range, making it clear what time each block represents.
- The "Time Allocation Totals" section shows running hours per category and overall, updated as you add, copy, load, or undo blocks.
- The "Undo Last Action" button reverts the last block placement, day copy, or day type application (up to 10 actions).
- The "Copy Day" feature duplicates a dayâ€™s schedule, and "Day Types" let you save and reuse schedules (e.g., for Work or Weekend days).
- The "Save Schedule" feature downloads a JSON file with all data, and "Load Schedule" restores it from a valid JSON file.
- The PDF export includes your name, a motivational summary, table, and pie chart, suitable for assignment submission.
- The single-day view, touch/click support, and responsive design (85vw grid, 80vh height) ensure a smooth mobile experience.
- Time markers are simplified (12AM, 6AM, 12PM, 6PM) for clarity, with precise alignment.
- Controls are always visible on desktop (â‰¥600px) and toggled via a prominent "â˜° Menu" button on mobile.
- If controls donâ€™t appear, tap/click the "â˜° Menu" button or check DevTools (F12) Console for errors.
- If loading or undoing fails, ensure the uploaded file is a valid `BlockTime_Schedule.json` or check if actions are available (check Console for error details).
- If you encounter issues (e.g., script loading), ensure files are in the same directory and use a local server. Test in Incognito mode to rule out extension interference (e.g., MindStudio content scripts).
- Future enhancements could include persistent storage via localStorage, swipe gestures, or default day types with pre-set categories.
