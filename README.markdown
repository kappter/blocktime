# BlockTime

## Overview
BlockTime is a minimalist web app designed to help users, particularly students, manage their weekly time allocation. Inspired by a Lego-based time management concept, it allows users to create custom categories, assign colors, and "drop" blocks into a 7-day grid (Monday to Sunday) to represent time spent on activities. Each block shows its category and time range (e.g., "Sleep: 8:00-8:30 PM"), with time labels (12AM, 6AM, 12PM, 6PM) integrated into the grid. Running totals for categories and the week are displayed below the grid. Users can copy days, save/apply day types (e.g., Work, Weekend), save/load schedules as JSON, and undo actions. The app supports time resolutions (15, 30, or 60 minutes) and generates a report with a summary, table, and pie chart, downloadable as a PDF. Itâ€™s optimized for desktop and mobile with a touch-friendly, simple design.

## Features

- **Save/Load Schedule**: Save the entire schedule (categories, grid, day types) as a JSON file and load it back to edit.
- **Undo Action**: Revert the last block placement, day copy, or day type application.
- **Legend**: Scrollable strip showing all categories and colors.

## Setup
1. **Download the App**:
   - Save the following files in a project folder:
     - `index.html` (main app structure)
     - `styles.css` (styling)
     - `script.js` (logic and PDF export)
2. **Run the App**:
   - Place all files in the same directory.
   - Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) on desktop or mobile.
   - For best results, use a local server (e.g., `python -m http.server` and access `http://localhost:8000`) to avoid file protocol issues.
   - No additional installation is required; the app uses pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
3. **Dependencies**:
   - Internet connection for CDNs:
     - Chart.js (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js`) for the pie chart.
     - jsPDF (`https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jspdf/2.5.1/jspdf.umd.min.js`) for PDF export.

## Notes
- The app runs in the browser and does not save data between sessions (day types, schedules, and undo stack reset on reload unless saved/loaded).
- Block labels show the category and time range, and time labels (12AM, 6AM, 12PM, 6PM) are integrated into the grid for clarity.
- The "Time Allocation Totals" section shows running hours per category and overall, updated as you add, copy, load, or undo blocks.
- The "Undo Last Action" button reverts the last block placement, day copy, or day type application (up to 10 actions).
- The "Copy Day" and "Day Types" features are in the manage section for streamlined planning.
- The "Save Schedule" and "Load Schedule" features allow persistent editing via JSON files.
- The PDF export includes your name, a motivational summary, table, and pie chart, suitable for assignment submission.
- The minimalist design (top for building, bottom for managing) and responsive layout (85vw grid, 80vh height) ensure a smooth mobile experience.
- Build controls are always visible on desktop (â‰¥600px) and toggled via a "â˜° Menu" button on mobile.
- If controls donâ€™t appear, tap/click the "â˜° Menu" button or check DevTools (F12) Console for errors.
- If loading or undoing fails, ensure the uploaded file is a valid `BlockTime_Schedule.json` or check if actions are available (check Console for errors).
- If you encounter issues (e.g., script loading), ensure files are in the same directory and use a local server. Test in Incognito mode to rule out extension interference (e.g., MindStudio content scripts).
- Future enhancements could include persistent storage via localStorage, swipe gestures, or default categories.
