## Test Results by Feature

### 1. Template Loading System

**Status**: ✅ FIXED AND WORKING

**Issue Identified**: Templates did not preserve when users changed time resolution (15/30/60 minutes)

**Root Cause**: When resolution changed, the grid regenerated and cleared template data

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added `currentTemplate` global variable to track loaded templates
- Created `applyTemplateSchedule()` function to separate template application from loading
- Modified `changeResolution()` to automatically reapply templates after grid regeneration
- Updated user feedback message to inform about resolution flexibility

**Test Cases**:
| Test Case | Resolution | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|---------|
| Load template at 60 min | 60 min | All 24 blocks filled | All 24 blocks filled | ✅ PASS |
| Change to 30 min | 30 min | All 48 blocks filled | All 48 blocks filled | ✅ PASS |
| Change to 15 min | 15 min | All 96 blocks filled | All 96 blocks filled | ✅ PASS |
| Change back to 60 min | 60 min | All 24 blocks filled | All 24 blocks filled | ✅ PASS |

**Verification**: Template data correctly fills all time slots regardless of resolution, with automatic preservation when switching between resolutions.
